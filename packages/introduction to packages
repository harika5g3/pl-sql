A package is a schema object that groups logically related PL/SQL types, variables, constants, subprograms, cursors, and exceptions. 
A package is compiled and stored in the database, where many applications can share its contents.

A package is a schema object that groups logically related PL/SQL types, variables, and subprograms. 
Packages usually have two parts, a specification (spec) and a body; sometimes the body is unnecessary. The specification is the interface to the package.
Declaration part: The below part is used for declaring all the variables, cursors, exceptions and other objects that we might need inside the package. 
These things can either be public or private. When they are public, they are being accessed and used by even other places outside the package.
