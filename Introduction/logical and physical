Oracle database architecture depends upon two types of storage: 
physical and logical. Physical (disk) storage contains all the files in the database. Logical storage structures, 
such as tablespaces, segments, extents, and blocks, appear on the disk but are not part of the dataset.
Logical storage helps users locate specific data and improves the efficiency of the retrieval process,
enabling a modular data storage system in which capacity can be adjusted without affecting performance.

A book serves as a helpful analogy for the difference between physical and logical storage.
A book's contents are printed on paper (physical storage), but additional information in the form of chapters,
page numbers, and footnotes (logical storage) helps readers navigate the book and its contents.

Logical storage is the contextual information that appears in the book, but isn't part of the book's story.
Rather, it's a guide to help you find specific information or mark your place.
