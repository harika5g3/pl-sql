INTRODUCTION TO SQL:::

Structured Query Language, abbreviated as SQL,
is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system,
or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system

DDL: Data Definition Language
What is Data Definition Language (DDL)? Data Definition Language (DDL) is used to create and modify the structure of objects in a 
database using predefined commands and a specific syntax.
These database objects include tables, sequences, locations, aliases, schemas and indexes.

DML: Data Manipulation Language
A data manipulation language is a computer programming language used for adding, deleting, and modifying data in a database. 
A DML is often a sublanguage of a broader database language such as SQL, with the DML comprising some of the operators in the language

TCL: Transaction Control Language
In SQL, TCL stands for Transaction control language. A single unit of work in a database is formed after the consecutive execution of commands is known as a transaction.
There are certain commands present in SQL known as TCL commands that help the user manage the transactions that take place in a database.

DCL: Data Control Language
Data Control Language(DCL) deals with the commands used in SQL that permit a user to access, modify or work on the different privileges in order to control the database.
It allows the owner of the database to give access, revoke access, and change the given permissions as and when required.

DQL: Data Query Language
The full form of DQL is Data Query Language. DQL is a part of the grouping involved in SQL (Structures Query Language) sub-languages. The SQL sub languages have four major categories, DQL, DDL, DCL, and DML.
