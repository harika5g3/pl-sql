Creates a DML, DDL, or logon trigger. A trigger is a special type of stored procedure that automatically runs when an event occurs in the database server. DML triggers run when a user tries to modify data through a data manipulation language (DML) event. DML events are INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements on a table or view. These triggers fire when any valid event fires, whether table rows are affected or not. For more information, see DML Triggers.

DDL triggers run in response to a variety of data definition language (DDL) events. These events primarily correspond to Transact-SQL CREATE, ALTER, and DROP statements, and certain system stored procedures that perform DDL-like operations.

Logon triggers fire in response to the LOGON event that's raised when a user's session is being established.
You can create triggers directly from Transact-SQL statements or from methods of assemblies that are created in the Microsoft .NET
Framework common language runtime (CLR) and uploaded to an instance of SQL Server.
SQL Server lets you create multiple triggers for any specific statement.

Where,

CREATE [OR REPLACE] TRIGGER trigger_name − Creates or replaces an existing trigger with the trigger_name.

{BEFORE | AFTER | INSTEAD OF} − This specifies when the trigger will be executed. The INSTEAD OF clause is used for creating trigger on a view.

{INSERT [OR] | UPDATE [OR] | DELETE} − This specifies the DML operation.

[OF col_name] − This specifies the column name that will be updated.

[ON table_name] − This specifies the name of the table associated with the trigger.

[REFERENCING OLD AS o NEW AS n] − This allows you to refer new and old values for various DML statements, such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

[FOR EACH ROW] − This specifies a row-level trigger, i.e., the trigger will be executed for each row being affected. Otherwise the trigger will execute just once when the SQL statement is executed, which is called a table level trigger.

WHEN (condition) − This provides a condition for rows for which the trigger would fire. This clause is valid only for row-level triggers.
